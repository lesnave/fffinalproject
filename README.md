# fffinalproject

For the language used I simply used JS with some help from Node. The only library used is the file system library for reading the file. I built it to be a cli. 
Usage is  Node main.js (file name for file that is desired to be processed in the same folder) (whether you want to exclude Stop Words true or false) (whether you want to remove suffixes from Words true or false)
